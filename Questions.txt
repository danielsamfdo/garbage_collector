What are the other Conditions that can or need to be checked for identifying a pointer assuming that endHeap is updated 
when a new object is allocated from the SourceHeap

GCMalloc<SourceHeap>::isPointer(void * p){
  if(startHeap<= p && p<=endHeap){
    // tprintf("checking @ is within @ and @",(size_t)&p, (size_t)&startHeap, (size_t)&endHeap);
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}



bytesAllocatedSinceLastGC -> should be updated based on whenever i get an object from source heap ?
